# Rubik's Cube in Unity

Full implementation of Rubik's Cube in Unity. You can download the end product from Google Play Store here: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatusko.Rubik

Feel free to use it as you like, however if you end up creating your own app basing it on my code, I would appreciate a lot if you linked this github repository and credited me in your app description :) 
Thanks!

## Features: 
: - Full Touch Support - Rotate cube around by touch the background and faces by touching the cube itself.
<br />: - Different Cube Sizes - Choose between easy 2x2x2, standard 3x3x3 or go crazy with 4x4x4.
<br />: - Lock Button - Locking the cube in place! Perfect once you've found a great angle and want to make sure it won't get changed.
<br />: - Scramble - Mix up your cube at any point throughout the game.
<br />: - Restart - Got annoyed with the current colour positions on your cube? Easy fix, just restart your game using the restart button provided in settings!
<br />: - Timer Toggle - Getting anxious when the clock is ticking while you're scratching your head over the devilish puzzle? Just turn the timer off using the provided settings!
<br />: - Zoom - Pinch/Spread the screen to either zoom in or zoom out on the cube.
<br />: - Portrait and Landscape modes both supported!
<br />: - Gyroscope - Move your phone around to move the on-screen cube! Mostly a fun addition, but maybe someone would prefer that control style?
